I am the group leader for the publication services team at Lib4RI, the joint library for the four national Swiss research institutes ([Eawag](https://www.eawag.ch/en/), [Empa](https://www.empa.ch), [PSI](https://www.psi.ch/en), [WSL](https://www.wsl.ch/en/)). Before, I worked as a postdoc in cell and molecular biologgy, before that I was a school teacher, and before that I was a PhD student. Check my [CV](https://mitchzw.github.io/cv/) if you want to read the details. 

This website tries to combine different use cases:

1) My personal website, close to the style of all the other personal websites of academics. For this purpose, you can find my [CV](https://mitchzw.github.io/cv/), my [publications](https://mitchzw.github.io/publications/), and lay summaries about my research (not done yet) on this website.
2) In my librarian job, I consult researcher also on how to increase their visibility and that of their research. A personal website can be a great tool to achieve this, especially for early career scientists. I try to use my website as a template and showcase for my [teachings](https://mitchzw.github.io/teaching/) about this topic.
3) How do we assess research? For research assessment on the level of individuals, narrative CVs are becoming more relevant. Quantitative metrics, on the other hand, should be abandoned (for example, H factor, journal impact factors) or be used more responsibly (for example, citation numbers). I would like to use my own example to try different ways to create a narrative CV that is supported by quantitative analysis of my research.
4) One day I might start adding [blog posts](https://mitchzw.github.io/year-archive/). Although, I'm not sure anyone needs this.

Feel free to have a look around and to get in touch with any question, feedback, ...
